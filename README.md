# Flower-Dataset-CNNClassifier
A CNN Prediction Model to predict the type of flower from a given image.



A Convolutional Neural Network build to classify the type of flower from a given input image.

The dataset is taken from one of tensorflow's dataset called 'flowers'. The dataset consists of more than 2 million images of flowers categorized into 5 flower categories, namely tulips, roses, dandelions, daisies, and sunflowers .I have built a CNN consisting of 4 Convolutional with activation function called 'Rectified Linear' unit and 2 Dense layers. The output is calculated using softmax activation function.

The Model achieves a training accuracy of 99%+ and a training loss of 0.0198.
